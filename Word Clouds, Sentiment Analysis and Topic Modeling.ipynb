returning to school because I was very shy I wasnt bullied but can understand how this makes school seem scary Its also wrong for your family to joke or make critical comments The good news is you can learn to eat properly and start easing yourself into exercise nHows the weight of the rest of your family  often the parents arent preparing or buying healthy food choices and usually other member have weight problems too Its better to come up with a healthy plan than continue this cycle Have a calm talk with your mom and tell her how this hurts your feelings and how youre struggling with anxiety I hope shell get you the right help and you can also speak with your school counselor You should go to school because it will only snowball if you dont go back You can change your life with the right guidance  hugs to you Facing what we fear is the hardest thing we have to do Im sorry that you have been bullied about your weight and that your family has been cruel to you There are a lot of factors that go into weight including hormones genetics diet thyroid exercise etc Have you been to your doctor about your weight It is possible a medical condition is making it hard for you to lose weight or even making it sure you will gain weight It is best to rule that out and also get some tips from the doctor about how to begin an exercise program If you get bullied at school please talk to your school counselor or a teacher That is what they are there for And if things get tough at home you can always talk to a school counselor or teacher about that too Right now it feels like everyone is staring at you and waiting for you to mess up but I promise you most people are anxious enough about going to school and messing up themselves that they arent looking for you to mess up There are always a few people of course who make themselves feel better by putting others down but the majority of people feel insecure themselves about a variety of issues I hope the rest of the school year goes well for you Try to keep an open mind about what others think of you and talk to someone when you need help Take care of yourself And be nice to yourself nBest nJunie ListenYou may not know mewell I meanno one cares about me butwhen people call you overweight or say mean things to youyou walk awayNo one deserves to be treated this wayIve felt down for so long and its gotten to my headEveryone is beautiful whether youre overweight or annarexic or anythingThe ugly people are the ones who always bully on people like you and meYou go prove everyone wrong and dont be scared to go to schoolYou might be an intelligent or are an intelligent girl and prove everyone wrong by losing weightfind yourself the motivationLookhold on to hope and I promise you will be fine and you will be better then those people who had bullied youThe only reason people bully each other is because they deny the fact that they themselves have a problem which doesnt make it any right No one cares about me but I care for the people who have been just as down as me and well I want you to knowwhen people say mean things to youyou walk away and prove them wrong cos in the end youll be the better one so please put all your courage to the testNever let go of hopeyou can be whatever you wanna be as long as you know in your heartyou will be better than all the mean people hurting you so please go on And live Ignore them if they are calling you overweight then they are insucure uHi u2013 some excellent advice above I think  nYou know some people are really shitty Unfortunately throughout life you will always encounter them As mentioned above those people who criticize often have their own insecurities unOne thing that deflates these bullying encounters is selfconfidence You must not show that you are affected by staring or comments These types of people find it amusing when the person that they are picking on react to their actions Donu2019t bite Donu2019t show that you are bothered Hold your head up high you have no reason to feel a lesser person that anyone else Smile as much as you can so you look happy and confident even if you are not nI would strongly recommend that you consider selfdefence classes such as Judo or Karate The exercise will help you lose weight but more importantly this type of activity will help build your selfconfidence greatly unRegarding drinking more water u2013 you can also drink TOO MUCH water Donu2019t overdo it you can make yourself ill nI wish you the best of luck and hope things are not too bad for you when you return to school I still hate it when I have to return to work after a vacation I have to work with some shitty people too  nDont let them grind you down x</td></tr>\n",

answering one anothers questions just never happened despite our best effort and no lack of new and interesting questions And dealing with certain housekeeping chores was becoming burdensome technicallychallenging and timeconsumingn n I want to thank bella Clyde Chemar and Edahn for trying their best to help others and providing thousands of answers to people seeking advice and guidancen n We never say never around here so theres always the possibility that we will bring this service back sometime in the future But for now were shutting it downn n In the meantime if youre looking for another place on Psych Central to ask a question of others we actually do have such a place on our forums or click on Community in the menu aboven n httpforumspsychcentralcomn n Youll need to register for a new account there it uses a different registration system than Answers if you dont already have one on the forums But its just as easy to ask a question there and of course freen n On behalf of

ended about 3 days ago and I cant really bring myself to go to school to face everyone The fact is that Im overweight because in my previous doctor visits my doctors told me to start drinking more water and exercise regularly Im a very shy person at school and have almost no friends since theyve either moved away or just started ignoring me It doesnt really help that I can feel the stares they give me when I pass by them and my family has always made jokes in front of me of the fact that Im chubby and they laugh at me and they hurt my feelings because Im not really content with myself and it just confirms my fears about what they think about me Especially my mom since I overheard her saying that shes disappointed at me and that Im fat and I need to lose weight I kind of feel like shouting at her that I know because my old clothes dont fit me at all anymoren n  I dont know why but whenever I come back from a long break from school I make up excuses not to go Its just that I feel like everyones watching and see me mess up and my palms get all sweaty and I start breathing really fast and I begged my mom not to let me go because I felt trapped Im claustrophobic like something bad was going to happen I felt like something was crawling all over my skin I just wanted to get awayn n I return to school tomorrow and I feel really anxious and I feel like I need to get help Sometimes I have flashbacks from when I was bullied because of how I looked and everything Mostly I think the world would be better if I hadnt been born such as not to cause anybody anymore problems than I already haven n n n n PLEASE Im begging you Your the only last source of help that I have right now Does anybody have any advice n n n n

                                                          & Hi shybookworm12  Im really sorry youre feeling upset and anxious Although Im older than you I can relate to feeling anxious about returning to school because I was very shy I wasnt bullied but can understand how this makes school seem scary Its also wrong for your family to joke or make critical comments The good news is you can learn to eat properly and start easing yourself into exercise nHows the weight of the rest of your family  often the parents arent preparing or buying healthy food choices and usually other member have weight problems too Its better to come up with a healthy plan than continue this cycle Have a calm talk with your mom and tell her how this hurts your feelings and how youre struggling with anxiety I hope shell get you the right help and you can also speak with your school counselor You should go to school because it will only snowball if you dont go back You can change your life with the right guidance  hugs to you Facing what we fear is the hardest thing we have to do Im sorry that you have been bullied about your weight and that your family has been cruel to you There are a lot of factors that go into weight including hormones genetics diet thyroid exercise etc Have you been to your doctor about your weight It is possible a medical condition is making it hard for you to lose weight or even making it sure you will gain weight It is best to rule that out and also get some tips from the doctor about how to begin an exercise program If you get bullied at school please talk to your school counselor or a teacher That is what they are there for And if things get tough at home you can always talk to a school counselor or teacher about that too Right now it feels like everyone is staring at you and waiting for you to mess up but I promise you most people are anxious enough about going to school and messing up themselves that they arent looking for you to mess up There are always a few people of course who make themselves feel better by putting others down but the majority of people feel insecure themselves about a variety of issues I hope the rest of the school year goes well for you Try to keep an open mind about what others think of you and talk to someone when you need help Take care of yourself And be nice to yourself nBest nJunie ListenYou may not know mewell I meanno one cares about me butwhen people call you overweight or say mean things to youyou walk awayNo one deserves to be treated this wayIve felt down for so long and its gotten to my headEveryone is beautiful whether youre overweight or annarexic or anythingThe ugly people are the ones who always bully on people like you and meYou go prove everyone wrong and dont be scared to go to schoolYou might be an intelligent or are an intelligent girl and prove everyone wrong by losing weightfind yourself the motivationLookhold on to hope and I promise you will be fine and you will be better then those people who had bullied youThe only reason people bully each other is because they deny the fact that they themselves have a problem which doesnt make it any right No one cares about me but I care for the people who have been just as down as me and well I want you to knowwhen people say mean things to youyou walk away and prove them wrong cos in the end youll be the better one so please put all your courage to the testNever let go of hopeyou can be whatever you wanna be as long as you know in your heartyou will be better than all the mean people hurting you so please go on And live Ignore them if they are calling you overweight then they are insucure uHi u2013 some excellent advice above I think  nYou know some people are really shitty Unfortunately throughout life you will always encounter them As mentioned above those people who criticize often have their own insecurities unOne thing that deflates these bullying encounters is selfconfidence You must not show that you are affected by staring or comments These types of people find it amusing when the person that they are picking on react to their actions Donu2019t bite Donu2019t show that you are bothered Hold your head up high you have no reason to feel a lesser person that anyone else Smile as much as you can so you look happy and confident even if you are not nI would strongly recommend that you consider selfdefence classes such as Judo or Karate The exercise will help you lose weight but more importantly this type of activity will help build your selfconfidence greatly unRegarding drinking more water u2013 you can also drink TOO MUCH water Donu2019t overdo it you can make yourself ill nI wish you the best of luck and hope things are not too bad for you when you return to school I still hate it when I have to return to work after a vacation I have to work with some shitty people too  nDont let them grind you down x\\\\\n",

ended about 3 days ago and I cant really bring myself to go to school to face everyone The fact is that Im overweight because in my previous doctor visits my doctors told me to start drinking more water and exercise regularly Im a very shy person at school and have almost no friends since theyve either moved away or just started ignoring me It doesnt really help that I can feel the stares they give me when I pass by them and my family has always made jokes in front of me of the fact that Im chubby and they laugh at me and they hurt my feelings because Im not really content with myself and it just confirms my fears about what they think about me Especially my mom since I overheard her saying that shes disappointed at me and that Im fat and I need to lose weight I kind of feel like shouting at her that I know because my old clothes dont fit me at all anymoren n  I dont know why but whenever I come back from a long break from school I make up excuses not to go Its just that I feel like everyones watching and see me mess up and my palms get all sweaty and I start breathing really fast and I begged my mom not to let me go because I felt trapped Im claustrophobic like something bad was going to happen I felt like something was crawling all over my skin I just wanted to get awayn n I return to school tomorrow and I feel really anxious and I feel like I need to get help Sometimes I have flashbacks from when I was bullied because of how I looked and everything Mostly I think the world would be better if I hadnt been born such as not to cause anybody anymore problems than I already haven n n n n PLEASE Im begging you Your the only last source of help that I have right now Does anybody have any advice n n n n

                                                          | Hi shybookworm12  Im really sorry youre feeling upset and anxious Although Im older than you I can relate to feeling anxious about returning to school because I was very shy I wasnt bullied but can understand how this makes school seem scary Its also wrong for your family to joke or make critical comments The good news is you can learn to eat properly and start easing yourself into exercise nHows the weight of the rest of your family  often the parents arent preparing or buying healthy food choices and usually other member have weight problems too Its better to come up with a healthy plan than continue this cycle Have a calm talk with your mom and tell her how this hurts your feelings and how youre struggling with anxiety I hope shell get you the right help and you can also speak with your school counselor You should go to school because it will only snowball if you dont go back You can change your life with the right guidance  hugs to you Facing what we fear is the hardest thing we have to do Im sorry that you have been bullied about your weight and that your family has been cruel to you There are a lot of factors that go into weight including hormones genetics diet thyroid exercise etc Have you been to your doctor about your weight It is possible a medical condition is making it hard for you to lose weight or even making it sure you will gain weight It is best to rule that out and also get some tips from the doctor about how to begin an exercise program If you get bullied at school please talk to your school counselor or a teacher That is what they are there for And if things get tough at home you can always talk to a school counselor or teacher about that too Right now it feels like everyone is staring at you and waiting for you to mess up but I promise you most people are anxious enough about going to school and messing up themselves that they arent looking for you to mess up There are always a few people of course who make themselves feel better by putting others down but the majority of people feel insecure themselves about a variety of issues I hope the rest of the school year goes well for you Try to keep an open mind about what others think of you and talk to someone when you need help Take care of yourself And be nice to yourself nBest nJunie ListenYou may not know mewell I meanno one cares about me butwhen people call you overweight or say mean things to youyou walk awayNo one deserves to be treated this wayIve felt down for so long and its gotten to my headEveryone is beautiful whether youre overweight or annarexic or anythingThe ugly people are the ones who always bully on people like you and meYou go prove everyone wrong and dont be scared to go to schoolYou might be an intelligent or are an intelligent girl and prove everyone wrong by losing weightfind yourself the motivationLookhold on to hope and I promise you will be fine and you will be better then those people who had bullied youThe only reason people bully each other is because they deny the fact that they themselves have a problem which doesnt make it any right No one cares about me but I care for the people who have been just as down as me and well I want you to knowwhen people say mean things to youyou walk away and prove them wrong cos in the end youll be the better one so please put all your courage to the testNever let go of hopeyou can be whatever you wanna be as long as you know in your heartyou will be better than all the mean people hurting you so please go on And live Ignore them if they are calling you overweight then they are insucure uHi u2013 some excellent advice above I think  nYou know some people are really shitty Unfortunately throughout life you will always encounter them As mentioned above those people who criticize often have their own insecurities unOne thing that deflates these bullying encounters is selfconfidence You must not show that you are affected by staring or comments These types of people find it amusing when the person that they are picking on react to their actions Donu2019t bite Donu2019t show that you are bothered Hold your head up high you have no reason to feel a lesser person that anyone else Smile as much as you can so you look happy and confident even if you are not nI would strongly recommend that you consider selfdefence classes such as Judo or Karate The exercise will help you lose weight but more importantly this type of activity will help build your selfconfidence greatly unRegarding drinking more water u2013 you can also drink TOO MUCH water Donu2019t overdo it you can make yourself ill nI wish you the best of luck and hope things are not too bad for you when you return to school I still hate it when I have to return to work after a vacation I have to work with some shitty people too  nDont let them grind you down x |\n",

       "2 Hi shybookworm12  Im really sorry youre feeling upset and anxious Although Im older than you I can relate to feeling anxious about returning to school because I was very shy I wasnt bullied but can understand how this makes school seem scary Its also wrong for your family to joke or make critical comments The good news is you can learn to eat properly and start easing yourself into exercise nHows the weight of the rest of your family  often the parents arent preparing or buying healthy food choices and usually other member have weight problems too Its better to come up with a healthy plan than continue this cycle Have a calm talk with your mom and tell her how this hurts your feelings and how youre struggling with anxiety I hope shell get you the right help and you can also speak with your school counselor You should go to school because it will only snowball if you dont go back You can change your life with the right guidance  hugs to you Facing what we fear is the hardest thing we have to do Im sorry that you have been bullied about your weight and that your family has been cruel to you There are a lot of factors that go into weight including hormones genetics diet thyroid exercise etc Have you been to your doctor about your weight It is possible a medical condition is making it hard for you to lose weight or even making it sure you will gain weight It is best to rule that out and also get some tips from the doctor about how to begin an exercise program If you get bullied at school please talk to your school counselor or a teacher That is what they are there for And if things get tough at home you can always talk to a school counselor or teacher about that too Right now it feels like everyone is staring at you and waiting for you to mess up but I promise you most people are anxious enough about going to school and messing up themselves that they arent looking for you to mess up There are always a few people of course who make themselves feel better by putting others down but the majority of people feel insecure themselves about a variety of issues I hope the rest of the school year goes well for you Try to keep an open mind about what others think of you and talk to someone when you need help Take care of yourself And be nice to yourself nBest nJunie ListenYou may not know mewell I meanno one cares about me butwhen people call you overweight or say mean things to youyou walk awayNo one deserves to be treated this wayIve felt down for so long and its gotten to my headEveryone is beautiful whether youre overweight or annarexic or anythingThe ugly people are the ones who always bully on people like you and meYou go prove everyone wrong and dont be scared to go to schoolYou might be an intelligent or are an intelligent girl and prove everyone wrong by losing weightfind yourself the motivationLookhold on to hope and I promise you will be fine and you will be better then those people who had bullied youThe only reason people bully each other is because they deny the fact that they themselves have a problem which doesnt make it any right No one cares about me but I care for the people who have been just as down as me and well I want you to knowwhen people say mean things to youyou walk away and prove them wrong cos in the end youll be the better one so please put all your courage to the testNever let go of hopeyou can be whatever you wanna be as long as you know in your heartyou will be better than all the mean people hurting you so please go on And live Ignore them if they are calling you overweight then they are insucure uHi u2013 some excellent advice above I think  nYou know some people are really shitty Unfortunately throughout life you will always encounter them As mentioned above those people who criticize often have their own insecurities unOne thing that deflates these bullying encounters is selfconfidence You must not show that you are affected by staring or comments These types of people find it amusing when the person that they are picking on react to their actions Donu2019t bite Donu2019t show that you are bothered Hold your head up high you have no reason to feel a lesser person that anyone else Smile as much as you can so you look happy and confident even if you are not nI would strongly recommend that you consider selfdefence classes such as Judo or Karate The exercise will help you lose weight but more importantly this type of activity will help build your selfconfidence greatly unRegarding drinking more water u2013 you can also drink TOO MUCH water Donu2019t overdo it you can make yourself ill nI wish you the best of luck and hope things are not too bad for you when you return to school I still hate it when I have to return to work after a vacation I have to work with some shitty people too  nDont let them grind you down x"

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>give

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>her

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>what

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>she

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>needs

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>heal

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>at

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>the

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>time

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>keeping

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>this

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>her

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>brother

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>and

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>to

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>mention

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>trying

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>get

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>to

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>work

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>time

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>this

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you</td><td>ishelpn

</td><td>You sound like an amazing mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & give

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & her

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & she

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & needs

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & at

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & the

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & same

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & keeping

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & this

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & from

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & her

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & brother

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & and

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & not

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & mention

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & trying

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & work

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & full

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & this

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & ishelpn

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you & n

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | give

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | her

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | what

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | she

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | the

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | same

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | this

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | from

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | brother

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | and

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | not

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | mention

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | trying

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | to

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | work

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | full

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | this

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | ishelpn

mother to both of your children But I think you are complicating things Your son knows something is going on He should be informed He will be angry later on if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on that so Ill give him one more day I think he knows I do most of all when I told him out of the blue that she was going into this intensive outpatient program he was like oh Ok Which is NOT a typical reaction for him because quite often he tries to parent her nAnd I know she IS still a virgin I told her that right away that that was NOT sex I did take her right away to a rape crisis center which coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly supportive Im pretty lucky in this aspect as it helps me then to be there emotionally for my daughterand soon my son  nman what a week Sorry editing isnt working  nit might catapult him to go for therapy imo HE needs to learn how to handle life issues and it sounds like he could use some therapy also Its not your secret Be sure to get permission from your daughter before you start sharing her private information with others including her brother  nI think it would be best for him to attend a family counseling session where he was told in the presence of a counselorsocial worker That way he know it was a part of his sisters recovery Its about her  nIf he needs further counseling then he should have his own counselor He does have a lot of stress with the college thing nRemember you are not your kids counselor You are the Mother They really just need your hugs and motherly guidance You are not responsible for their feelings And if you need counseling please dont hesitate to seek out it nId give you a big hug if I could Cyberhug to you | n

like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right

if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I am going to have to do it soon He just found out he got a full ride scholarship to a top ivy league the top which is a huge deal because we are poor in a relative sense so everyone is riding high on

coincidentally is located down the hall from the IOPwe did the intake on Friday and it went really wellthe counselor that shell be seeing seemed really awesome and suited to my daughterwho is very adverse to psychobabble the Im ok youre ok schoolshe wants practical advice on how to deal w this and I think this will be a good person for her to work with So theres a lot of relief there Plus the schools been pretty good about the whole thing so far as she has missed an entire week And Im not sure if shell make it Monday Thank God she starts the program Monday I am so grateful for that because I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly

if he was not told which will be worse for everyone You daughter also needs his support Keeping this information quiet also reinforces shame in date rape situations Also your daughter should know that she can press charges against the individual This can be empowering and help with the depression You need a really good therapist experienced in sex crimes and family counseling Good luck You know I think he does knowshe is not yet ready to deal with telling him so We are going this morning for an intake for admission to an intensive outpatient programmaybe in the context of that program Im sorry to hear of this victimization Trying to keep it secret is a natural part of the issue But if the brother finds out it might be a catapult for imo HE needs to learn to handle life issues and sounds like he could use some therapy also  nThe main emphasis is immediate treatment for your daughter You didnt share if she went to an ER or rape center at all nor if she is in any kind of therapy right now Waiting is not good The sooner she can be helped to process what happened to her the easier not easy it will be to move on with life PTSD is a beast of a disorder and needs direct attention Even if that therapy changes soon down the road it will be the same road overall nThe brother can be told when she is not around and given time and effort to help him realize the type of support she needs from him He could really be a pivotal aspect of her healing if he can do that Maybe go with HIM to a therapist so you can work through the knowledge and find out good support together  nThis is time for an adult decision regardless of what your daughter fears Dont do this with her but inform her its the right thing to do Adding stress to your lives at this point is not a good decision  nFocus needs to be on the victim and not those around her imo BTW I still consider her a virgin Take care   Thank you DrJean You know it didnt even occur to me to tell him without her there Duh Yeah I know I

I know shell be in good handsits like 4 hours a day and part of that time shell be with the rape counselorsfor the time being Im giving her lots of love and attention I want her to know that she is still my little girl always always always  nAnd you are right about my son Ive had him in counseling before but its not been so successful because he is loathe to talk I have to remember that I sometimes get a warped view because I know I am the only one he feels comfortable talking to and therefore tend to be the garbage pail of his angst And sometimes hell really pour it out and two minutes later hell be fine and happy and Ill be like AAAGH nYes I am going to tell my son and very soon We are a family with a very strong emphasis on being honest with each other and it just feels wrong Because of my absence at work I had to tell my managers and they have been typically and unbelievably supportiveI am so luckyand I have a couple of good friends who have also been incredibly
